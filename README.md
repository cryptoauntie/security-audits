# Security Audit Review Findings

This repository follows my journey as an independent blockchain and smart contract security researcher. It contains my reports from security focused code reviews of Web3 projects and protocols.

These reports were prepared for Audit Contests and Bounties on various platforms. Plus a few just for fun. 

Feel free to check out my Solodit profile for more information and engagements:Â [here](https://profiles.cyfrin.io/u/cryptoauntie)

Currently, I'm a freelance security researcher available for Web3 security consulting and security reviews. 

For inquiries, reach out on Discord or email.
